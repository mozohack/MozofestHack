## SkyWalkAR

### "Space ka Jugaad."

## Inspiration -

Space is dark yet cool and everyone wants to travel. “The universe
is big. It’s vast and complicated and ridiculous. And sometimes,
very rarely, impossible things just happen and we call them
miracles.”, but ever imagined how is the experience of the
astronauts who are thousands of miles away into the dark and
lonely space manage to reach the right place and come back
safely?
The people helping them from here may also Lag a little and have
no clue what happens when this happen?
Also not everyone has the right to access the space. Researchers
around the world rely on specific sources which is huge barrier
sometimes.

## What it does

“SkyWalkAR“ is a web and mobile application that helps explore
the universe . With our application you can travel from one place
to another place along the optimal path , and orbit or look at the
elements of the universe . All the coordinates of the space , the
speed of the spaceship and the distance from the destination is
displayed in realtime in the application.With our application you
can travel time also.From our application one can record their
travel and these datasets can be used with our machine learning
algorithms to gain insights of the space.Besides all these we have
SRM MOZOFEST 2019 1
a free roam feature in which you can just control your spaceship
and travel the space just as you play a car race game in your PC.
This all is also possible in AR using your phone and the path which
travelled gets recorded automatically as soon as the connectivity is
lost with the helpers here.


## How we plan to build it -

Using Web Technologies like using HTML,CSS, Javascript,
AngularJS, Three.js and Python.Javascript is the primary language
we used to built the entire application and python was used for
developing the machine learning SDK.We used three.js for
rendering all the 3D figures used in the application.We have used
the MVC architecture for developing the application.The exact
distance and position of all the elements in the universe is
calculated with the help of an algorithm which uses Kepler
formula and the Julerian calculations. The app also calculates and
stores the real time path which will be travelled and for this we
will be using iOS’s new framework “ARKit” for the same.

## Challenges and Bottlenecks -

Deciding the final algorithm for final algorithm to calculate the
suboptimal path to travel in between the planets and in
understanding the formulas of Kepler and the Julian day
calculations . In developing the application three.js library is a little
difficult to implement for rendering the 3d objects of the universe
and for generating the proper datasets which could improve the
experience of space travel .
Creating the AR Objects with perfectness and proper details will
also be a challenging task.
